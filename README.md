This is a simple React app demonstrating **user authentication** with **Redux Toolkit** for state management, including **protected routes** and **login functionality** using the DummyJSON API.

## Features
- **Login System:** Uses Redux to manage user authentication.
- **Protected Routes:** Protects routes with Redux state for secure access.
- **Async Logic:** Uses Redux's `createAsyncThunk` for handling login requests and API calls.
- **Persistent Login:** Saves user authentication info in the Redux store and localStorage for persistence.

## Tech Stack
- **React.js** for the frontend
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **React Router** for routing
- **DummyJSON API** for simulating real-world login functionality
